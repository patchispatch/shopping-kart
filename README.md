# Shopping Kart (name subject to change)

## What is (or what will be) Shopping Kart (name subject to change)?
Shopping Kart (name subject to change) is a game about old people buying stuff. The kind of old people who rush into the supermarket with their own,
fire-extinguiser-powered blinded carts. So that's pretty much about it. 

## The game itself (or what I expect it to be when it's more advanced)
Los coches de choque.

## Notes
This is my first take on game development, so don't expect too much.
The code will be horrible, the game will be horrible and the ideas aren't good either.
But hey, it's a start. So I hope it becomes less horrible in the future.
